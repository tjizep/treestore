Removed dependancy to "lz4_encoder.h" and "lz4hc_encoder.h"
Improved speed of LZ4_decompress_fast() with GCC
Improved speed of LZ4_decompress_safe() for 32-bits
Made the fast LZ4 compression compatible with low-memory systems (buffer adddress < 64K). Thanks Francois Gretief for report and suggestion.
Makefile : added fuzzer32
Makefile : added fullbench32
fullbench : added ability to select one specific function to benchmark
lz4.c : copy macros follow memcpy() arguments convention
Small coding style modifications, hinted by cppCheck.
